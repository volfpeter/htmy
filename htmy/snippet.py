class Slots:

    Utility that resolves slots in a string input to components.

    More technically, it splits a string into slot and non-slot parts, replaces the
    slot parts with the corresponding components (which may be component sequences)
    from the given slot mapping, and returns the resulting component sequence.

    The default slot placeholder is a standard XML/HTML comment of the following form:
    `<!-- slot[slot-key] -->`. Any number of whitespaces (including 0) are allowed in
    the placeholder, but the slot key must not contain any whitespaces. For details, see
    `Slots.slot_re`.

    Besides the pre-defined regular expressions in `Slots.slot_re`, any other regular
    expression can be used to identify slots as long as it meets the requirements described
    in `Slots.slots_re`.

class Snippet:
    """
    Component that renders text, which may be asynchronously loaded from a file.

    **Warning:** The component treats its input as trusted. If any part of the input comes from
    untrusted sources, ensure it is safely escaped (using for example `htmy.xml_format_string`)!
    Passing untrusted input to this component leads to XSS vulnerabilities.

    The entire snippet processing pipeline consists of the following steps:

    1. The text content is loaded from a file or passed directly as a `Text` instance.
    2. The text content is processed by a `TextProcessor` if provided.
    3. The processed text is converted into a component (may be component sequence)
       by a `TextResolver`, for example `Slots`.
    4. Every `str` children (produced by the steps above) is converted into a `SafeStr` for
       rendering.

    The pipeline above is a bit abstract, so here are some usage notes:

    - The text content of a snippet can be a Python format string template, in which case the
      `TextProcessor` can be a simple method that calls `str.format()` with the correct arguments.
    - Alternatively, a text processor can also be used to get only a substring -- commonly referred
      to as fragment in frameworks like Jinja -- of the original text.
    - The text processor is applied before the text resolver, which makes it possible to insert
      placeholders into the text (for example slots, like in this case:
      `..."{toolbar}...".format(toolbar="<!-- slot[toolbar] -->")`) that are then replaced with any
      `htmy.Component` by the `TextResolver` (for example `Slots`).
    - `TextResolver` can return plain `str` values, it is not necessary for it to convert strings
      to `SafeStr` to prevent unwanted escaping.

    Example:

    ```python
    from datetime import date
    from htmy import Snippet, Slots

    def text_processor(text: str, context: Context) -> str:
       return text.format(today=date.today())

    snippet = Snippet(
        "my-page.html",
        text_processor=text_processor,
        text_resolver=Slots(
            {
                "date-picker": MyDatePicker(class_="text-primary"),
                "Toolbar": MyPageToolbar(active_page="home"),
                ...
            }
        ),
    )
    ```

    In the above example, if `my-page.html` contains a `{today}` placeholder, it will be replaced
    with the current date. If it contains a `<!-- slot[toolbar] -->}` slot, then the `MyPageToolbar`
    `htmy` component instance will be rendered in its place, and the `<!-- slot[date-picker] -->` slot
    will be replaced with the `MyDatePicker` component instance.
