Strings are also components, as well as lists or tuples of <code>HTMYComponentType</code> or string objects. In many cases though, you don't even need to create components, simple functions that return components will be sufficient -- you can find out more about this in the Components guide of the documentation.</p> <p>Using the <code>htmy()</code> method name enables the conversion of any of your pre-existing business objects (from <code>TypedDicts</code>s or <code>pydantic</code> models to ORM classes) into components without the fear of name collision or compatibility issues with other tools.</p> <p>Async support makes it possible to load data or execute async business logic right in your components. This can reduce the amount of boilerplate you need to write in some cases, and also gives you the freedom to split the rendering and non-rendering logic in any way you see fit.</p> <p>Example:</p> <pre><code>from dataclasses import dataclass\n\nfrom htmy import Component, Context, html\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True, slots=True)\nclass User:\n    username: str\n    name: str\n    email: str\n\n    async def is_admin(self) -&gt; bool:\n        return False\n\nclass UserRow(User):\n    async def htmy(self, context: Context) -&gt; Component:\n        role = \"admin\" if await self.is_admin() else \"restricted\"\n        return html.tr(\n            html.td(self.username),\n            html.td(self.name),\n            html.td(html.a(self.email, href=f\"mailto:{self.email}\")),\n            html.td(role)\n        )\n\n@dataclass(frozen=True, kw_only=True, slots=True)\nclass UserRows:\n    users: list[User]\n    def htmy(self, context: Context) -&gt; Component:\n        # Note that a list is returned here.

Some of the most popular examples are: Reflex, NiceGUI, ReactPy, and FastUI.</p> <p>The main benefit of these frameworks is rapid application prototyping and a very convenient developer experience, at least as long as you stay within the built-in feature set of the framework. In exchange for that, they are very opinionated (from components to frontend tooling and state management), the underlying engineering is very complex, deployment and scaling can be hard or costly, and they can be hard to migrate away from. Even with these caveats, they can be a very good choice for internal tools and application prototyping.</p> <p>The other end of spectrum -- plain rendering engines -- is dominated by the Jinja templating engine, which is a safe choice as it has been and will be around for a long time. The main drawbacks with Jinja are the lack of good IDE support, the complete lack of static code analysis support, and the (subjectively) ugly custom template syntax.</p> <p>Then there are tools that aim for the middleground, usually by providing most of the benefits and drawbacks of complete application frameworks while leaving state management, client-server communication, and dynamic UI updates for the user to solve, often with some level of HTMX support. This group includes libraries like FastHTML and Ludic.</p> <p>The primary aim of <code>htmy</code> is to be a <code>Jinja</code> alternative that is similarly powerful and flexible, while also providing the benefits of full IDE support, static code analysis, and native Python (and HTML, XML, markdown) syntax.

Imagine, that you have a web application in which the client submits an <code>X-Variant</code> request header to tell the server how to render the response (typical scenario with HTMX), for example as a list item or a table row. If you add this information to the rendering context, your enhanced business objects can use this information to conditionally fetch more data and render themselves the way the client requested. (This is facilitated out of the box by FastHX for example.)</p> <p>Here is the pseudo-code for the above scenario:</p> <pre><code>@dataclass\nclass User:\n    name: str\n    email: str\n    permissions: list[str] | None = None\n\n    async def htmy(self, context: Context) -&gt; Component:\n        request_headers = context[\"request_headers\"]\n        variant = request_headers.get(\"X-Variant\", \"list-item\")\n        if variant == \"list-item\":\n            return await self._htmy_li(context)\n        elif variant == \"table-row\":\n            return await self._htmy_tr(context)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Unknown variant\")\n\n    async def _htmy_li(self, context: Context) -&gt; Component:\n        return html.li(...)\n\n    async def _htmy_tr(self, context: Context) -&gt; Component:\n        # Make sure permissions are loaded, the table row representation needs them.\n        await self._load_permissions()\n        return html.tr(...)\n\n    async def _load_permissions(self) -&gt; None:\n        # Load user permissions and store them in self.permissions.\n        ...\n</code></pre> <p>Hopefully these examples give you some ideas on how you can efficiently integrate <code>htmy</code> into your application and business logic.</p> <p>Unleash your creativity, and have fun building your next web application!

The performance benefit comes from the fact these functions are executed instantly, and the <code>htmy</code> renderer only needs to resolve the resulting component tree, which will be smaller than the one that uses components for everything.</p> <p>Component factories come with some limitations and downsides though:</p> <ul> <li>Often they can not be async, because they are called from sync code.</li> <li>They have no access to the rendering context.</li> <li>They can not act as context providers.</li> <li>They are immediately evaluated, which can be undesirable if they create a large component tree.</li> </ul> <p>Note that when you create the component tree you want to render, you (almost) always \"call\" something with some arguments: either a component factory or an actual component class, the latter of which is just the instantiation of the component class (potentially an enhanced business object).</p> <p>There is one important detail you must pay attention to: if a component factory returns a component sequence, then it's up to you make sure the returned component sequence is correctly passed to the \"parent\" component or component factory, because for example <code>list[list[ComponentType]]</code> is not a valid component sequence, only <code>list[ComponentType]</code> is. List unpacking and the built-in <code>Fragment</code> component can help you avoid potential issues.</p> <p>It may be unnecessary to say, but you don't need to bother with the above issue if you use components, they can return component sequences and the renderer will deal with them, it's a standard use-case.</p>"},{"location":"components-guide/#when-to-use-components-when-to-use-component-factories","title":"When to use components, when to use component factories?","text":"<p>There is no hard rule, but hopefully the previous sections gave you enough guidance to make an informed decision in every case.

This is especially impractical when the component has no properties.</p> <p>Function components address these issues by allowing you to fully skip class creation and define the component simply as a function (well, or method, as we'll see later).

Actually, since all four types of function components look different (remember that methods require the <code>self</code> argument as well), the <code>@component</code> decorator has one variant for each of them:</p> <ul> <li><code>@component</code> (and its <code>@component.function</code> alias) for functions with a properties and a context argument.</li> <li><code>@component.context_only</code> for functions with only a context argument.</li> <li><code>@component.method</code> for instance methods with a properties and a context argument.</li> <li><code>@component.context_only_method</code> for instance methods with only a context argument.</li> </ul> <p>Technical note: the <code>@component</code> decorators change the decorated function's signature.

The text content is loaded from a file or passed directly as a `Text` instance.\n    2. The text content is processed by a `TextProcessor` if provided.\n    3. The processed text is converted into a component (may be component sequence)\n       by a `TextResolver`, for example `Slots`.\n    4.

Looking at this from another perspective, most HTML/XML snippets can be parsed by markdown parsers without issues. This means that while the below examples work with text files with markdown syntax, those file could also contain plain HTML snippets with no \"markdown\" at all. You will start to see the full power of this concept by the end of this article.</p> <p>Warning: The <code>MD</code> component treats its input as trusted.

This example demonstrates how you can use it together with <code>Slots</code> to render plain <code>.html</code> files and replace slots in them with <code>htmy</code> components dynamically.</p> <p>In the example, we will build a <code>FastAPI</code> application that will serve our components using the <code>FastHX</code> library. Let's start by installing the required dependencies: <code>pip install fastapi fasthx htmy uvicorn</code>.</p> <p>We will use TailwindCSS v4 for styling, but it will be loaded from a CDN, so we don't need any JavaScript tooling. Also, you don't need to be familiar with TailwindCSS to understand the example, just ignore the styling.</p> <p>One additional note, before we start coding: the <code>MD</code> component (for markdown rendering) supports all the features of <code>Snippet</code>, so you can directly use all the patterns in this example with markdown files and the <code>MD</code> component.</p> <p>Our project structure will look like this:</p> <ul> <li><code>layout.html</code>: The HTML snippet for the <code>layout</code> <code>htmy</code> component.</li> <li><code>centered.html</code>: The HTML snippet for the <code>Centered</code> <code>htmy</code> component.</li> <li><code>app.py</code>: All our <code>htmy</code> components and the <code>FastAPI</code> application.</li> </ul> <p>Let's start by creating the <code>layout.html</code> file. Layouts often require a deeply nested component structure, so it's a good idea to use <code>Snippet</code> for then with dynamic slot rendering, because it improves performance and you can write almost the entire HTML structure in native <code>.html</code> files (without custom syntax).</p> <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Snippet with Slots&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" /&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@tailwindcss/browser@4\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body class=\"w-screen h-screen bg-gray-300 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-white\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"w-full grid grid-rows-[max-content,1fr] p-8 gap-4\"&gt;\n      &lt;p class=\"text-center\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"font-semibold text-lg\"&gt;Technologies:&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;a\n          href=\"https://volfpeter.github.io/htmy/\"\n          class=\"text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          &gt;htmy&lt;/a\n        &gt;,\n        &lt;a\n          href=\"https://volfpeter.github.io/fasthx/\"\n          class=\"text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          &gt;FastHX&lt;/a\n        &gt;,\n        &lt;a\n          href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\"\n          class=\"text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          &gt;FastAPI&lt;/a\n        &gt;,\n        &lt;a\n          href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\"\n          class=\"text-blue-600 visited:text-purple-600\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n          &gt;TailwindCSSv4&lt;/a\n        &gt;.\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"h-full w-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;!-- slot[content] --&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, we have the basic HTML document definition and some static content in this file, including a <code>&lt;!-- slot[content] --&gt;</code> marker (plain HTML comment), which will be resolved by <code>Snippet</code> to the correct <code>htmy</code> component during rendering.</p> <p>Next, we will create the <code>centered.html</code> file, which will be a lot simpler. Actually, it's so simple we shouldn't even use <code>Snippet</code> for it (a plain <code>htmy</code> component would be simpler and more efficient), but we will, just to showcase multiple <code>Snippet</code> usage patterns.</p> <pre><code>&lt;div class=\"flex flex-col w-full h-full items-center justify-center\"&gt;\n  &lt;!-- slot[content] --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This HTML file also contains a <code>&lt;!-- slot[content] --&gt;</code> marker, but the slot's key (<code>content</code>) could be anything else. The important thing, as you'll see below, is that the <code>Slots()</code> instance of the <code>Snippet()</code> contains the right component for the right slot key.</p> <p>We have all the HTML we need for our <code>Snippet</code>s, so we can finally get started with the application in <code>app.py</code>. We will do it step by step, starting with the <code>layout</code> component (factory):</p> <pre><code>from fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fasthx.htmy import HTMY, CurrentRequest\n\nfrom htmy import ComponentType, Context, Fragment, Slots, Snippet, html\n\n\ndef layout(*children: ComponentType) -&gt; Snippet:\n    \"\"\"\n    Creates a `Snippet` that's configured to render `layout.html` with the given children\n    components replacing the `content` slot.\n    \"\"\"\n    return Snippet(\n        \"layout.html\",  # Path to the HTML snippet.\n        Slots({\"content\": children}),  # Render all children in the \"content\" slot.\n    )\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, <code>layout</code> is not even an <code>htmy</code> component, it's just a simple function that returns a <code>Snippet</code> that's configured to load the <code>layout.html</code> file we previously created, and render the given children components in place of the <code>content</code> slot.</p> <p>Now we can implement the <code>Centered</code> component. In this case we use a slightly different pattern, we subclass the component from the <code>Fragment</code> component: this way we get the <code>_children</code> property without having to write the <code>__init__(self, *children)</code> method.</p> <pre><code>class Centered(Fragment):\n    \"\"\"Component that centers its children both vertically and horizontally.\"\"\"\n\n    def htmy(self, context: Context) -&gt; Snippet:\n        return Snippet(\n            \"centered.html\",  # Path to the HTML snippet.\n            Slots({\"content\": self._children}),  # Render all children in the \"content\" slot.\n        )\n</code></pre> <p>Unlike <code>layout</code>, this component only creates the configured <code>Snippet</code> instance during rendering (in the <code>htmy()</code> method). In this simple case there's not much difference between the two patterns, but <code>Centered</code> could technically have extra state, take values from <code>context</code>, execute business logic, and use the extra data to configure the <code>Snippet</code> instance.</p> <p>We create one more component (<code>RequestHeaders</code>), just to have something that's not built with <code>Snippet</code>. This component simply shows all the headers from the current request in a grid:</p> <pre><code>class RequestHeaders:\n    \"\"\"Component that displays all the headers in the current request.\"\"\"\n\n    def htmy(self, context: Context) -&gt; html.div:\n        # Load the current request from the context.\n        request = CurrentRequest.from_context(context)\n        return html.div(\n            html.h2(\"Request headers:\", class_=\"text-lg font-semibold pb-2\"),\n            html.div(\n                *(\n                    # Convert header name and value pairs to fragments.\n                    Fragment(html.label(name + \":\"), html.label(value))\n                    for name, value in request.headers.items()\n                ),\n                class_=\"grid grid-cols-[max-content_1fr] gap-2\",\n            ),\n        )\n</code></pre> <p>The final step before creating the FastAPI application is to create a function that returns the content of the index page:</p> <pre><code>def index_page(_: None) -&gt; Snippet:\n    \"\"\"\n    Component factory that returns the index page.\n\n    Note that this function is not an `htmy` component at all, just a\n    component factory that `fasthx` decorators can resolve. It must\n    accept a single argument (the return value of the route) and return\n    the component(s) that should be rendered.\n    \"\"\"\n    return layout(Centered(RequestHeaders()))\n</code></pre> <p><code>index_page()</code>, similarly to <code>layout()</code> is also not a component, just a function that returns a component. Specifically, it shows the <code>RequestHeaders</code> component, centered in the page. We don't really need this function, we could use <code>lambda _: layout(Centered(RequestHeaders()))</code> instead in the <code>FastHX</code> <code>page()</code> decorator, but the example is more readable and easier to follow this way.</p> <p>Finally, we everything is ready, we can create the FastAPI application itself:</p> <pre><code>app = FastAPI()\n\"\"\"The FastAPI application.\"\"\"\n\nhtmy = HTMY()\n\"\"\"\nThe `HTMY` instance (from `FastHX`) that takes care of component rendering\nthrough its route decorators.\n\"\"\"\n\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\n@htmy.page(index_page)\nasync def index() -&gt; None:\n    \"\"\"The index route. It has no business logic, so it can remain empty.\"\"\"\n    ...\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>@htmy.page()</code> decorator takes care of rendering the result of the <code>index()</code> route with the component the <code>index_page()</code> function returns. The only thing that remains is to run the application with <code>python -m uvicorn app:app</code>, open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in the browser, and see the result of our work.</p>"}]}
